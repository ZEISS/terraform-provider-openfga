## Get Started

This template supports `Makefile` to run tooling.

> `make` is choosen as it is available on most systems.

```bash
# show `help`
make help
```

Other available targets are

* `build`
* `fmt`
* `lint`
* `vet`
* `generate`
* `clean`

The convention is to use `make` to run the build.

Happy coding!
